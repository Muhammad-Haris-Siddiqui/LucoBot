# LucoBot Frontend Setup Guide

## Overview
This is the frontend application for the LucoBot receptionist robot. It provides the robot's interface, camera integration, and user interaction capabilities.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
- Backend robot server running (see backend documentation)

## Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install iOS dependencies (macOS only):**
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

## Configuration

### 1. Update Backend IP Address
Edit `config/apiConfig.js` and update the `BASE_URL` to match your backend server's IP address:

```javascript
BASE_URL: 'http://YOUR_BACKEND_IP:8000',
```

### 2. Android Permissions
The app requires the following permissions:
- Camera access
- Microphone access
- Internet access

These are automatically requested by the app.

## Running the App

### Android
```bash
npm run android
```

### iOS (macOS only)
```bash
npm run ios
```

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Robot face with animated expressions
- [x] Camera integration for continuous frame capture
- [x] API service layer for backend communication
- [x] Dynamic UI based on robot responses
- [x] Text input and button interactions
- [x] Speech-to-Text integration
- [x] Error handling and loading states
- [x] Landscape orientation lock
- [x] Immersive mode for full-screen experience

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Testing with actual backend
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error recovery mechanisms

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **Test with Backend**: Connect to your robot backend server
2. **Configure IP**: Update the IP address in `config/apiConfig.js`
3. **Test Camera**: Ensure camera permissions work correctly
4. **Test Speech**: Verify speech-to-text functionality
5. **Test Interactions**: Verify all UI interactions work properly

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- Ensure camera permissions are granted
- Check if camera is being used by another app
- Restart the app if camera doesn't initialize

### Network Issues
- Verify backend server is running
- Check IP address in `config/apiConfig.js`
- Ensure device and backend are on same network

### Speech Recognition Issues
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted
- Check if speech recognition is available on device
- Try restarting the app
